Scribe Finder will be used by specially abled candidates who need the help of writers or readers during exams.
Here a candidate can come and search for volunteering scribes based on their requirements.
Both scribe and candidate will have to register and login first to send and accept requests.
Scribe will have to upload his/her audio and writing sample and other information like whether he/she wants to be a reader( for VI candidates) or writer( for candidates who can't write) or comfortable with both, what are their language preferences, their cities, whether they are comfortable with online exams(bank, railway) or offline exams(school or university exams) or both, whether they want to give written exam format(UPSC mains, school or university) or mcq pattern(bank, railway) or are comfortable with both.
Based on these information filled by the scribe a candidate can filter scribes.
Candidates will fill exam information after logging in and find scribes according to that, then send request, if scribe agrees, he/she will accept it.

NOTE:
1. candidates with scribe facility get 10 minutes extra over every 30 minutes.
2. Financial matters between scribe and candidate will be solved between themselves.
3. In exams like bank or railway, it is mandatory that the scribe's educational qualification is less than that of the candidate's qualification, so filtering has to be done according to that also.
